<h1> Death is long </h1>

<p>
Shootin' shit up 'fore we shoot the fade
I got secrets that I'm takin' to my grave
Talkin' the language 'cause my squad don't know how to behave
Got a whip and a chain to the game, I'll never be a slave
Stackin' my racks, dawg, do you got my back, dawg?
Cover my back, dawg, yeah (cover my back)
I know Zoes at max, dawg, chopper blow your back off
If you play with my racks, dawg, yeah
Can't take no risk, ever since I went legit
If you got my back, grab the chopper, let it rip
I got my stick way before I laced my kicks
Gotta keep a stick with these diamonds on my fist (yeah)
I stay with snakes, yeah they slimy and they hiss (slatt)
Y'all did great, tried to line me and you missed (yeah)
Heavyweight, my watch cost more than a brick (more than a brick)
I couldn't wait, got the Urus with the kit (skrrt)
Shootin' shit up 'fore we shoot the fade
I got secrets that I'm takin' to my grave
Talkin' the language 'cause my squad don't know how to behave
Got a whip and a chain to the game, I'll never be a slave
Stackin' my racks, dawg, do you got my back, dawg?
Cover my back, dawg, yeah (cover my back)
I know Zoes at max, dawg, chopper blow your back off
If you play with my racks, dawg, yeah
Told bro to leave it at home and he still brought it in (brought it in)
Said he got my back and they don't wanna see me win
We shootin', scorin', stayin' high above the rim (above the rim)
We gon' roll 'em up and blow our opps into the wind (wind)
I wanna wrist shop, I don't know which watch

Had to scrape up re-rock, gotta keep a G-lock
Just in case I see opps, yeah (yeah)
Shootin' shit up 'fore we shoot the fade
