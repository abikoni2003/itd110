Wake up in the mornin', know I gotta do this shit

Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind?
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
Four, five, six, seven bitches keep callin' my line
Ya cap like Mitchell and Ness lil' nigga stop lyin'

Spanish bitch come and pipe me I can make my wife (my wife)
She want new Versace, put Medusa on her eyes

Trippin' off lanes, I don't think you really wanna ride
Guns don't want mine on you, you not my kind
I say something ain't worth it, ain't wastin' my time
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here

Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
